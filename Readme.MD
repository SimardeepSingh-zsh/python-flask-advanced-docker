# Python Flask Advanced Docker

Welcome to the Python Flask Advanced Docker repository! This repository showcases an advanced Dockerfile template for deploying a Python Flask application. The Dockerfile includes features like multi-stage builds, caching optimizations, and a well-organized directory structure.

## Introduction

Dockerizing Python applications is a common practice, and this repository provides an advanced Dockerfile template for Flask applications. The template follows best practices, includes multi-stage builds to optimize the final image, and offers a structured approach for managing dependencies.

## Features

- **Multi-Stage Builds:** Optimized Dockerfile with separate stages for base image, build dependencies, application build, and production.
  
- **Caching Optimizations:** Dependencies are installed in a separate layer to leverage caching and speed up subsequent builds.

- **Well-Organized Directory Structure:** Encourages a structured approach for managing application code and dependencies.
